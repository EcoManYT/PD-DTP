Hello! its me Matt, i'm the creator of this program.This program was created for testing my new 128x64 lcd display
i got for christmas and because i'm a sucker for physics, programing challenges and logical thinking i decided to
create this little program for fun and for me to learn something new! Now the only things you should change to use
your own display is the dw variable, dh variable and the display driver on line 48 BUT! i have included more 
variables to play around with the physics simulations! i have also tried my best to comment on everything,
So i guess you can start doing stuff!

Also if have any issues dm me on reddit username: Eco_Man_Redditer
